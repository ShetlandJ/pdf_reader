Remember



The cost of repairs may influence the amount someone is prepared to pay for the property. We recommend


that relevant estimates and reports are obtained in your own name.



Warning



If left unattended, even for a relatively short period, Category 2
repairs can rapidly develop into more serious


Category 3 repairs. The existence of Category 2 or Category 3 repairs may have an adverse effect on marketability,


value and the sale price ultimately achieved for the property. This is particularly true

during slow market conditions


where the effect can be considerable.


Category 3

Urgent repairs or replacement are
needed now. Failure to deal with
them may cause problems to
other parts of the property or
cause a safety hazard. Estimates
for repairs or replacement are
needed now.

Category 2

Repairs or replacement requiring
future
attention, but estimates are
still advised.

Category 1

No immediate action or repair is
needed.
